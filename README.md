# Foody_IngNutty_Android_App

This is an Android application project that I am completing and continuing for my 2nd-year university degree. This idea came to my mind because I’m a consumer who makes attention to off-the-shelf food ingredients and nutrition. To be aware of that must check with the actual product which is on shelves or at home. From this application able to browse on a fingertip to get aware of foods ingredients and nutrition.
